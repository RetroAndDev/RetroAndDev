# Retro&Dev — Student · Developer · Builder
<img align="right" width="320" src="./imgs/Profile.png" />

👋 Hello — I'm **Retro&Dev**.

I’m currently in **BTS SIO (1st year, SSIR)**, and I build apps and games while studying network and systems engineering. I collect retro games, tinker with engines, and enjoy solving hard technical problems—especially when they help students learn better. Everything started on 15 November 2017 (with Unity). Since then, I'm trying to build the future.

---

## 🔭 Current focus & philosophy
I build projects that solve real problems for students and that I want to use myself. I favour clean UX, performant backends, and pragmatic automation. I split my time between StudySuite (school app), game mods, and tooling for hobbyist developers.

## ⚡ Fun corner
> *“If we shipped it. It (just) works.”* — **Retro&Dev**

He starts dozens of projects and finishes a few, but when he ships a build the reaction is always the same: *it just works.* Behind the scenes, updates are epic — sometimes they break everything; sometimes he spends hours implementing the logic and… forgets the button that triggers the action (StudySuite friends: we remember...)
